The Chianti region occupies provinces of Florence, Arezzo, and Siena. Thus we only extract data for these provinces. 

We use the coordinates of our site interview to identify farm parcels that we "know" to be owned by the farm. We then cross-reference the beneficiary ("beneficiar") as per the ARTEA beneficiary registry (Ricerca su ALBO BENEFICIARI ARTEA) to identify parcels that share the same beneficiary. We assume this means they are owned by our farm of interest.
